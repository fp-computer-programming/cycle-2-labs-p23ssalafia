a = 3
b = a
#both variables should be 3. If we know "a" is 3 and "b" is equal to "a" then "b" must be 3.
print (a)
print (b)
#confirmed a and b are 3

a = 7
print (a)
print (b)
#Because a now becomes 7 later in the code, the value of a changes to 7, but because b isn't equal to a now, it remains 3.
